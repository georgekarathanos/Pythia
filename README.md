# Pythia: Data Profiling Enhancement through Machine Learning Techniques  

Welcome to the repository for my diploma thesis, **"Data Profiling Enhancement through Machine Learning Techniques"**. This repository contains the implementation of the Pythia system as it was at the time of my thesis.  

Pythia is a data analysis system designed to process large datasets efficiently and automatically extract valuable insights. It integrates advanced algorithms and techniques to simplify data analysis and allow analysts to focus on interpreting results rather than the complexities of data processing.  

## Overview  

Data analysis has become a cornerstone of modern research, with applications spanning numerous scientific fields. However, challenges such as the sheer volume of data and the selection of appropriate techniques for specific datasets often hinder effective analysis.  

Pythia addresses these challenges by:  
- **Automating data analysis**: Accepting a dataset as input, processing it, and generating detailed reports.  
- **Providing advanced capabilities**: Identifying hidden patterns, calculating key statistics, and generating decision trees.  

In this thesis, Pythia was enhanced by integrating two core machine learning techniques:  
1. **Regression**: Uncovering correlations between dataset features.  
2. **Clustering**: Implementing various clustering algorithms to provide optimal clusters based on the dataset.  

The enhancements were rigorously tested and evaluated to ensure robustness and accuracy, adhering to the principles of extensibility and maintainability established by the existing Pythia system.  

## Repository Contents  

- **`Pythia Source Code`**: The Java implementation of Pythia, showcasing its state during my thesis.  
- **`thesis_text.txt`**: The full text of my diploma thesis in English.  
- **`thesis.pptx`**: The thesis presentation in Greek.  

## Future Development  

Pythia is an ongoing project, and future versions can be found in the repository maintained by the DAINTINESS Group:
